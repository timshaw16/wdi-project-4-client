##What is Rupauls Drag Race?

Rupauls Drag Race is like America's next top model but for Drag Queens.

The website showcases the seasons (from Season 5 to the current season(9)) and the queens that have taken park in those seasons.

##Biggest Wins
The home page of the site is a parallax which took be about 4 hours to complete one sunny Sunday afternoon. This is probably my proudest accomplishment of this project.

**Planning**

Again for this project I used Trello to help me with the planning of this app.

**Wireframing**

I used JustInMind as my wireframe tool which I prefer over Balsamiq due to vast amount of tools it allows you to use.
